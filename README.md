# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

Using R for statistical analysis

Upper management has approached Jeremy and the data analytics team to solve the production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing’s team´s progress for AutosRU´s newest prototype, the MechaCar.

Deliverable 1

Our first task is to perform a multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the data set predict the Mile per Gallon (mpg) of MechaCar prototypes.

Multiple linear regression builds a linear regression model with two or more independent variables.

linear regression tests the following hypotheses:

H0 : The slope of the linear model is zero, or m = 0

Ha : The slope of the linear model is not zero, or m ≠ 0

Deliverable 2
The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. 

ACCCording to the total summary we see the variance is close to the 100 pounds which is not ideal, therefore is better to look at each lot individually to understand the data. When we take a closer look at the Variance from Lot 3 is clear that there is a problem with the manufacturing of MechaCar suspension coils, thus not meeting the current manufacturing requirements.

Deliverable 3
We use a t-test to compare the mean of one dataset to another under a few assumptions.

Ho : There is no statistical difference between the observed sample mean of PSI and its presumed population mean of 1500. Ha : There is a statistical difference between the observed sample mean of PSI and its presumed population mean.

Design for a statistical study

A new statistical study is to be designed to compare performance of the MechaCar vehicles against performance vehicles from other manufactures. In the study we can use metrics of interest to the consumer such as cost, highway fuel efficiency, horsepower, maintenance cost, safety rating, and an approximate cost of insurance.
